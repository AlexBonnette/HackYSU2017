# HackYSU2017
This is for all code and documentation regarding my group HackYSU 2017 project: Arduino Dungeon Master. Four other YSU students
worked with me on this endeavor.

See PowerPoint for a breakdown of the project functionality.

Regarding the maze setup, it is not, as we would have liked, completely random. Unfortunately, it is "hard-coded" (i.e. the maze 
setup is the same each and every time), due to lack of time to develop such a complex algorithm. See "Maze Map" for the maze setup.

We would have made the wiring neater, had time and the fact that we did not own all wires prevent us from so doing (such a 
wiring cleanup would have involved cutting some, if not all, wires; this we refused to do on that which we were not truly free 
to alter in such a fashion).

At this event, all projects were judged, and three winners selected. While Arduino Dungeon Master project did not place, 
it nonetheless garnered a considerable amount of attention, receiving entirely positive comments from fellow "hackers" who came
and tried our project out.
